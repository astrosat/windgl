# WindGL

A WebGL-powered visualization of wind power using custom Mapbox Layers.
Capable of rendering up to 1 million wind particles at 60fps.

## Usage

```sh
npm install --save @astrosat/windgl
```

```javascript
import {Map} from 'mapboxgl';
import {sampleFill, particles, source, arrows} from '@astrosat/windgl';

// 1. Create a source
const windSource = source('http://url/to/backend');

const map = new Map(...);

map.addLayer(sampleFill({
  id: 'windbackground', // required
  source: windSource, // required
  'sample-fill-opacity': 0.8 // optional
}));

map.addLayer(particles({
  id: 'particles',
  source: windSource, // best to share the same source between all layers
  'particle-speed': ['interpolate', ['zoom'], 0, 0.5, 10, 0.8]
  // you can use mapbox style expressions
}));

map.addLayer(arrows({
    id: 'arrows',
    source: windSource
}), "waterway-label"); // inserting the layer in the middle of the layer stack is supported
```

## Layers

This package offers several ways to visualize wind speed.

### Sample Fill

![Sample Fill](./demo/random/sampleFill.png)

This layer will use a color map to show the wind speed at each pixel (interpolated from the data set). You can customize it with the following properties:

#### `sample-fill-color`

A `color` value. You can interpolate based on zoom or using data-driven styling (`["get", "speed"]` will get the speed at the current pixel). The default value is a nice color scale:

```json
[
  "interpolate",
  ["linear"],
  ["get", "speed"],
  0.0,
  "#3288bd",
  10,
  "#66c2a5",
  20,
  "#abdda4",
  30,
  "#e6f598",
  40,
  "#fee08b",
  50,
  "#fdae61",
  60,
  "#f46d43",
  100.0,
  "#d53e4f"
]
```

#### `sample-opacity`

A `number` between `0` and `1`. Indicates the global opacity of the layer. You can use zoom for styling.

### Particles

![Particles](./demo/random/particles.png)

A particle layer showing wind speed by animating particles based on the wind speed. You can customize it with the following properties:

#### `particle-color`

A `color` value. You can interpolate based on zoom or using data-driven styling (`["get", "speed"]` will get the speed at the current particle). The default value is `white`.

#### `particle-speed`

A positive `number`. Indicates how quickly the particles move (i.e. is a multiplier for the speed vector from the dataset). Can be interpolated based on zoom levels. Default is `0.75`.

You can adjust the properties by calling `setProperty(property, value)`.

### Arrows

![Arrows](./demo/random/arrows.png)

A vector field layer. You can customize it with the following properties:

#### `arrow-min-size`

A positive `number`. In general, this layer will attempt to draw an arrow at every grid point of the underlying data. However, sometimes that would result in really tiny arrows. So if the size of the arrow would be less than this limit, we will switch to interpolation and show a larger arrow aggregating multiple values. Default is 40px.

#### `arrow-color`

A `color` value. You can interpolate based on zoom or using data-driven styling (`["get", "speed"]` will get the speed at the current grid point). The default value is `white`.

#### `arrow-halo-color`

A `color` value. You can interpolate based on zoom. The color of an outline drawn around the arrow. Defaults to transparent.

## Limitations

3. Datasource tiling isn't implemented.

## Backend

The backend format will be documented later. Sorry. The main idea is that it should return a small JSON and an image that encodes the grib data. See `demo/2016112000.json` as an example.
